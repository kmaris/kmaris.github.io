<p>Yeah, I still play Morrowind (with OpenMW) and love to use mods like Tamriel
Rebuilt, Wyrmhaven, Beware the Sixth House, etc. In my case I installed a mod,
<em>on a fresh character!</em>, that changed buildings (Beautiful Cities of Morrowind).
Upon entering the Ald Skar Inn, whom do I find? Nobody. Nada. Bupkiss.</p>
<p>Weird, I thought. It was at the momentary epiphany that I started falling.
And FAST. And PASSING other unforunates.</p>
<p>Oh hey, it&rsquo;s all of the inn dwellers and we&rsquo;re racing to oblivion. And lo and
behold, Hassour Zainsubani is kinda important for the main quest. If he dies
Caius drops you like it&rsquo;s HOT and your main quest is kaput with the classic
message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The path to your destiny is blocked&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also never saw the other clear signal you&rsquo;re screwed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With this character&rsquo;s death, the thread of prophecy is severed. Restore a
saved game to restore the weave of fate, or persist in the doomed world you
have created.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That sucks!&rdquo;, &ldquo;WHAT THE FUCK&rdquo;, &ldquo;How did that happen?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sigghhhh&hellip;..&rdquo;.
Surprise, confusion, grief, acceptance. One might call these the seven
(okay not seven) stages of playing Morrowind.</p>
<h3 id="lets-fix-it">Lets fix it</h3>
<p>Alright, you don&rsquo;t want to start a new character and all the snappy bitches on
reddit that tell you to do so can fuxk off. You&rsquo;ll need a hex editor (I use HxD
on windows) so get that or something similar if you don&rsquo;t have it. Also this is
for OpenMW. If you&rsquo;re still playing OG morrowind, switch over. You&rsquo;ll be happier
for it. You&rsquo;ll need to be able to use the console by pressing the ~ key
in-game. There are many guides and videos on youtube if you need more help.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, save your game as it is.</li>
<li>Now, create ANOTHER save, with a filename you&rsquo;ll remember that signifies that
is the one you will edit.</li>
<li>Resurrect your NPC, I am using Hassour Zainsubani for example but others will
be similar.</li>
<li>Use the hex editor to reset the death count to zero.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resurrection">Resurrection</h2>
<p>Stand where you want to place the NPC, I generally stand where they would be
before mod fuckery. Get the position and note the outputs of the commands:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>player-&gt;GetPos x
player-&gt;GetPos y
player-&gt;GetPos z
</code></pre><p>You will get a numeric output for each, in my case in Ald Skar Inn they were:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>x = 495.423950
y = -1562.035156
z = -254.999969
</code></pre><p>Your numbers probably won&rsquo;t match mine. Now move your character a few steps
away, and revive the npc.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;hassour zainsubani&#34;-&gt;PositionCell, 495.423950, -1562.035156, -254.999969, 0, &#34;Ald-ruhn, Ald Skar Inn&#34;
</code></pre><p>That will spawn him, dead or alive. Or should, I guess. If he&rsquo;s dead, then bring
him back:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;hassour zainsubani&#34;-&gt;Resurrect
</code></pre><p>Now that he&rsquo;s alive and well, save and quit the game.</p>
<h2 id="edit-death-count">Edit death count</h2>
<p>Find your OpenMW saves folder, for me on windows 11 it is in
<code>Documents\My Games\OpenMW\saves\&lt;your character&gt;\</code>.</p>
<p>Make a backup then open the .omwsave file that you want to edit. Search for the
name of the npc you resurrected, ie &ldquo;hassour&rdquo;. There will be several matches,
but go until you see something resembling <code>hassour zainsubabiCOUN....</code>. The
trailing periods (representing bytes) are what we&rsquo;ll be editing.</p>
<p>Now we need to find the byte to edit. Immediately after COUN will be a number
(4 in the screenshot below, underlined in red).</p>
<img src="hassour_coun.png">
<p>Ignore that and find the <em>next</em> number, 2 as shown in the next screenshot.
Set that 2 to 0 (zero), underlined in red.</p>
<img src="hassour_deadcount_reset.png">
<p>Save the file and try playing your game! If all goes well Caius won&rsquo;t be pissed
at you anymore. If it fails to load (expecting different numbers) then you
edited the wrong thing.</p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>Here are a few links to help find info about npc names/id (their ID is often
their name). And also a link to console command reference as well as where
I found interior cell names which you&rsquo;ll need to specify when running the
PositionCell command.</p>
